            Lions are the only truly social cats. ... A pride is usually made up of lionesses, their cubs, and a few male lions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lionesses do the majority of the hunting while the males mostly guard the pride and provide protection for the cubs
        </p>
        <p>
            The lionesses work together to hunt and can bring down large prey like water buffalo.
